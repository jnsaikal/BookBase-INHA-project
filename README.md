BookBase is an educational project developed by students from Inha University. 
It is a program designed for book managing, that allows you to track favorite, read, and to-read books. 
Users can sign up, log in to their accounts, view and update personal information, add books to their favorites, mark books as read, and maintain a list of books they intend to read in the future.
